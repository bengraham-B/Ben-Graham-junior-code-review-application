# Worst-Case Space Complexity: numbers.js

Altough arrays in javascript are dynamic the arrays which are used in my solution are static as they contain the words of numbers such as 'one', 'twenty' and 'one million' and will not change while using the application 

Therefor the worst-case space complexity of my solution can be defined as:
```
O(1)
```
